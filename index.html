    <h1>Why Copenhagen?</h1>
    <h2>Copenhagen, the city of Spirels</h2>
    <p> Known as the <strong>City of Spires</strong>, Copenhagen’s skyline is adorned with towers that echo its rich history. From the twisting spire of <strong>Our Saviour’s Church</strong> to the regal green towers of <strong>Rosenborg Castle</strong>, these architectural gems are a testament to the city’s evolution from a Viking fishing village in the 10th century to Denmark’s vibrant capital.  
         Walking through <strong>Nyhavn</strong>, with its colorful 17th-century houses lining the canals, or climbing the <strong>Round Tower</strong> for sweeping views of terracotta rooftops and the Øresund Strait, you’ll see how history and modernity coexist in harmony.  
        Beyond its beauty, Copenhagen exudes the Danish spirit of <strong>hygge</strong>—a sense of warmth and coziness found in candlelit cafes, tranquil parks, and the charm of <strong>Tivoli Gardens</strong>. It’s a city that invites you to slow down, explore its timeless streets, and embrace its serene, yet dynamic atmosphere
        .</p>
